Hi, my name is Mohammad Al-Shimari. I was born and raised in Seattle, WA and I enjoy hiking along the Cascades, playing basketball with my friends, and challenging myself to learn new technical skills. 

I completed the user experience design certification program at Bellevue college in 2019 and am currently working to further develop my technical skills through the Year Up program at Seattle Central college where I am enrolled in the app development and testing track. I enjoy creating unique, user-minded, webpages that reflect my creativity and convey a clear purpose to the audience and my goal is to find an opportunity in tech to apply my skills within the greater Seattle area. 

In 2017, I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology from UC Berkeley and worked as a paralegal at a law firm in San Francisco dealing with personal injury cases. In 2020, I decided to move back to my hometown of Seattle, WA to challenge myself to learn coding and web development.
